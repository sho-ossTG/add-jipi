<objective>
Convert the milestone audit dependency-outage debt item into an executable manual verification runbook.

Purpose: Ensure broker/Redis outage behavior can be validated in live conditions with deterministic pass/fail criteria.
Output: Outage checklist with scenario steps, commands, expected outcomes, and evidence template.
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Finalize broker/Redis outage verification matrix</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/06-milestone-audit-cleanup/06-MANUAL-OUTAGE-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>Refine the outage runbook so each scenario (broker timeout/unavailable, Redis timeout/unavailable, capacity/shutdown deny) has explicit actions and expected response behavior. Keep all commands manual-only for network-enabled tester machines.</action>
  <verify>Runbook includes preconditions, commands, scenario checklist, expected outcomes, and evidence template.</verify>
  <done>Outage verification debt item is operationalized into repeatable manual validation steps.</done>
</task>
</tasks>

<verification>
No network calls from this machine. Verification is document completeness and scenario coverage.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Outage manual verification can be executed by operators without ambiguity and with consistent evidence capture.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-milestone-audit-cleanup/06-02-SUMMARY.md`
