<objective>
Resolve the non-blocking `modules/index.js` informational-surface tech debt with a low-risk, explicit decision.

Purpose: Remove ambiguity for maintainers by either wiring useful consumption paths or documenting intentional non-runtime status.
Output: Clear, durable resolution reflected in code/docs.
</objective>

<tasks>
<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Decide and implement modules/index.js cleanup path</name>
  <files>modules/index.js, modules/BOUNDARIES.md</files>
  <action>Choose one path and implement it with minimal risk: (A) wire legitimate consumption (developer-facing import map usage), or (B) keep informational but explicitly document why and where it should be used. Avoid broad refactors; this is debt cleanup, not architecture expansion.</action>
  <verify>Decision is reflected in file content and boundary docs; no contradictory guidance remains.</verify>
  <done>`modules/index.js` no longer appears as ambiguous debt and has explicit maintainership guidance.</done>

<success_criteria>
The `modules/index.js` debt item is closed with an explicit, documented, low-risk resolution.
