# Milestone 1.0 Audit Report

## Overall Result

- Status: `tech_debt`
- Requirements: `16/16` satisfied
- Phases: `5/5` verified
- Integration: `10/10` cross-phase checks passed
- E2E flows: `3/3` structurally complete

No critical blockers were found. Milestone intent is achieved. Non-blocking debt and human-environment checks remain.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement Group | Total | Satisfied | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contract Compatibility (CONT) | 3 | 3 | ✓ |
| Security (SECU) | 4 | 4 | ✓ |
| Reliability (RELY) | 3 | 3 | ✓ |
| Observability (OBSV) | 3 | 3 | ✓ |
| Maintainability (MAINT) | 3 | 3 | ✓ |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **✓** |

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Verification File | Status | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01-contract-compatibility-baseline | `.planning/phases/01-contract-compatibility-baseline/01-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 6/6 |
| 02-security-boundary-hardening | `.planning/phases/02-security-boundary-hardening/02-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 7/7 |
| 03-stream-reliability-controls | `.planning/phases/03-stream-reliability-controls/03-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 8/8 |
| 04-observability-and-diagnostics | `.planning/phases/04-observability-and-diagnostics/04-observability-and-diagnostics-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 7/7 |
| 05-modularization-and-test-governance | `.planning/phases/05-modularization-and-test-governance/05-VERIFICATION.md` | passed | 5/5 |

## Cross-Phase Integration Audit

Integration checker result: `passed` (`10/10`)

Confirmed wiring and flow continuity:

- Install addon -> manifest/catalog -> stream request path remains intact after modularization.
- Operator diagnostics flow remains auth-gated and routed through shared observability projection boundaries.
- Degraded/fallback reliability behavior remains deterministic and connected through routing + presentation modules.
- Security, reliability, observability, and modular routing boundaries compose correctly in `http-handler` and `serverless` thin adapter.

## E2E Flow Assessment

| Flow | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install -> browse -> stream | ✓ Complete | Contract path verified by phase checks and integration audit |
| Operator diagnostics/auth flow | ✓ Complete | Auth boundary + sanitized diagnostics verified |
| Dependency degradation fallback flow | ✓ Complete | Deterministic fallback/degraded mapping verified |

## Tech Debt and Deferred Items

| Phase | Item | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Real Stremio client install/playback still needs live-environment verification | Low |
| 03 | Real broker/Redis outage behavior still needs live-environment verification | Low |
| 05 | `modules/index.js` currently informational (no runtime consumer) | Low |

## Conclusion

Milestone 1.0 definition of done is met for requirements, phase delivery, and cross-phase integration. Remaining items are non-blocking operational validation/debt and can be tracked as follow-up work.
